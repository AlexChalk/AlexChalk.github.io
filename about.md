### About Me

I'm a grad student in International Affairs at [Carleton](https://carleton.ca/npsia/), and
my goal is to work with government on the challenges posed by state-of-the-art neural
networks.

I received robust analytical training when studying philosophy at Oxford, and I gained
quantitative skills and deep technical knowledge from five years as a professional
programmer. 

I am fluent in Python, I have built several small neural networks, and I have a reasonable
understanding of the attention-based transformer architectures that are used by large
language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT (I have yet to actually go through [Attention Is All
You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) line-by-line alongside the pytorch transformer
implementation, but it's on my todo list). 

I have spent time with researchers at Mila (informally), I remain in touch with the field,
and I am confident that I can go more deeply into both academic literature and work on
practical implementations of models where useful.

I'm unsure of how I can be most impactful on AI, but one possibility is to increase technical
literacy on a team to a point where they could have useful conversations with computer
scientists. Concretely, this might involve leading a group through online courses like
Andrew Ng's materials on Coursera, and facilitating dialogue with interested folks from
research labs. 

I believe that some grasp of how neural networks are built is necessary to understand the
ways they may not act as intended, and that this understanding is crucial to many, perhaps
most, major decisions regarding AI that government will face. 

Unrelatedly, I don't use social media, so this website is one of the only ways people from
my past can reconnect with me! In the interests of showing up when they search for me on
the internet, here are some places I've been: International Guitar Festival (IGF), St
Bartholomew's School in Newbury (St Bart's), Mansfield College, University of Oxford,
Busbud, Procurify, the Choir of the Church of St. Andrew and St. Paul (A&P).

If in doubt, please send me a message!
