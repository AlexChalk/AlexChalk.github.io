### About Me

I'm a graduate student and Joubin-Selig Scholar in International Affairs at [Carleton](https://carleton.ca/npsia/), and my goal is to work with government on the challenges posed by state-of-the-art neural networks.

I received analytical training in philosophy at Oxford, and I gained quantitative skills and technical knowledge from five years working as a programmer at tech startups. 

I am fluent in Python, I have built several small neural networks, and I have a reasonable understanding of the attention-based transformer architectures of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. I have yet to go through [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) line-by-line alongside the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) transformer implementation, but it's on my to do list. 

I have spent time with researchers at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) (informally), I remain in touch with the field, and I am confident that I can go more deeply into both academic literature and work on practical implementations of models where useful.

I'm unsure of how I can be most helpful with AI, but one possibility is to increase technical literacy on a team to a point where they could have useful conversations with computer scientists. Concretely, this might involve leading a group through online courses like Andrew Ng's materials on Coursera, and facilitating dialogue with interested folks from research labs. 

I believe that some grasp of how neural networks are built is necessary to understand the ways they may not act as intended, and that this understanding is crucial to many, perhaps most, major decisions regarding AI that government will face. I also believe governments require sufficient technical know-how to critically assess researchers' opinions and to form their own conclusions.

Unrelatedly, I don't use social media, so this website is one of the only ways people from my past can reconnect with me. In the interests of showing up when they search for me on the internet, here are some places I've been: International Guitar Festival (IGF), St Bartholomew's School in Newbury (St Bart's), Mansfield College, University of Oxford, Busbud, Procurify, the Choir of the Church of St. Andrew and St. Paul (A&P).

If in doubt, please send me a message!
