As I am notoriously difficult to buy presents for, I've decided to help you out with a list of things I like!

#### Camellia Sinensis

I love the Québec teahouse Camellia Sinensis. They will ship tea anywhere in Canada, so you can order me some tea on [their website][camellia-sinensis-link] and get it delivered to my address. Please steer clear of smoky varieties like Lapsang Souchong, but I'll drink any other tea you send me.

#### Bandcamp

Bandcamp is my preferred choice for listening to music. You have to pay for records you listen to more than a few times (like in the old days), and the company commission on sales is means-tested, which means lesser-known artists receive almost all of the money you pay (and even successful artists keep >80%). If you buy me a [gift card][bandcamp-gift-card-link] on their site then you can help me find and enjoy new music.

#### Bonsai Tree

My bonsai did not survive our recent move, so I'm looking for a new one. I'd like something with a wide trunk that's good for beginners and not fussy about lighting. I've been looking at a Ficus Bonsai (like my last one) or a Chinese Elm.

#### Machine Learning Computer

I'm working on machine learning, but renting cloud-based GPUs is expensive, and the companies doing it don't sell gift cards. If you're feeling very generous (or coordinating with others), I'm therefore looking for a computer with a discrete GPU to use as a server for ML training runs. However, it's best to contact me if you're interested in helping with this, as it's important to make sure I get the right device.

#### Frank and Oak

Frank and Oak is a Montréal-based clothing company. I like their clothes, but I would prefer [gift cards][frank-and-oak-link] so that I can pick out what I want for myself.

#### Socks

Socks are always welcome, and I am partial to a pricey brand called Darn Tough. I'm a men's size medium, and my preferred sock style is micro crew. You can choose me a nice (but subtle) design and ship it to me from [their website][darn-tough-link].

#### Cordless Vacuum

I'd like a cordless stick vacuum. I mostly trust [The Wirecutter][wirecutter-cordless-vacuum-link] for this sort of purchase, which means the model I'm after is the Ryobi 18V One+ HP (but check the link to make sure it's still recommended). It's sold exclusively via [Home Depot][ryobi-link]—please get the model that comes with a charger.

#### Books

I'm very picky about what I read, so trying to choose a book for me is probably not a good idea. However, if there is ever a book I'd like to receive, I'll add it to a list on this page.

Thank you for being interested in buying me a present!
