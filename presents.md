As I am notoriously difficult to buy presents for, I've decided to help you out with a list of things I like!

#### Camellia Sinensis

I love the Québec teahouse Camellia Sinensis. They will ship tea anywhere in Canada, so you can order me some tea on [their website][camellia-sinensis-link] and get it delivered to my address. Please steer clear of smoky varieties like Lapsang Souchong, but I'll drink any other tea you send me.

#### Books

I'm very picky about what I read, so trying to choose a book for me is probably not a good idea. However, I'll definitely read anything from the list below:
- Study of Counterpoint: From Johann Joseph Fux's Gradus ad Parnassum—Translated and edited by Alfred Mann 

#### Bandcamp

Bandcamp is my preferred choice for listening to music. You have to pay for records you listen to more than a few times (like in the old days), and the company commission on sales is means-tested, which means lesser-known artists receive almost all of the money you pay (and even successful artists keep >80%). If you buy me a [gift card][bandcamp-gift-card-link] on their site then you can help me find and enjoy new music.

#### Bonsai Tree

My bonsai did not survive our recent move, so I'm looking for a new one. I'd like something with a wide trunk that's good for beginners and not fussy about lighting. I've been looking at a Ficus Bonsai (like my last one) or a Chinese Elm.

#### Cordless Vacuum

If you are feeling very generous (or coordinating with others), I'd really like a cordless stick vacuum. I mostly trust [The Wirecutter][wirecutter-cordless-vacuum-link] for this sort of purchase, which means the model I'm after is the Ryobi 18V One+ HP (but check the link to make sure it's still recommended). It's sold exclusively via [Home Depot][ryobi-link]—please get the model that comes with a charger.

#### Frank and Oak

Frank and Oak is a Montréal-based clothing company. I like their clothes, but I would prefer [gift cards][frank-and-oak-link] so that I can pick out what I want for myself.

#### Socks

Socks are always welcome, and I am partial to a pricey brand called Darn Tough. I'm a men's size medium, and my preferred sock style is micro crew. You can choose me a nice (but subtle) design and ship it to me from [their website][darn-tough-link].

#### Keycaps

I am a programmer with a very nerdy keyboard:

Indulge my nerdiness by buying me some custom keycaps for my keyboard! Just make sure that they are PBT keycaps and OEM Profile. There is a list of online keycap sellers available [on reddit][keycaps-link]. Weird and colourful keycaps that do not necessarily depict letters are preferred!

#### Machine Learning

For computer nerds only. I'm looking for resources to level up in machine learning, and, if you happen to be an expert in this area, I'd be interested in anything you can personally vouch for. One idea I had was to ask for credit to rent cloud-based GPUs, but I haven't found a company that sells gift cards for this.

Thank you for being interested in buying me a present!
