This jupyter notebook takes a stab at interactively explaining the Central Limit Theorem, as well as how it relates to the core methodologies of classical statistics. It is loosely based around lectures 6–8 of [MIT OpenCourseWare 6.0002][mit-link], but it aims to be less technical than those. The notebook was originally paired with an in-person presentation.
